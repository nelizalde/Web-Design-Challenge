# Web Visualization Dashboard (Latitude)

## Background

Data is more powerful when we share it with others! Let's take what we've learned about HTML and CSS to create a dashboard showing off the analysis we've done.

## Latitude - Latitude Analysis Dashboard 

This website presents different visaulization dashboards from a previous API Project. In these visauls, I've demonstrating various filtering abilites
within my index file by creating different elements for filtering.The app.js file has the event listener modified to detect changes on certain event triggers on all
filters.

Additionally, you'll also find my written analysis for each visual with the corresponding images
displayed in optimal locations. 

This website and project was a great way to showcase some fun front-end esthetics using HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

### Website

The website consists of 7 pages total, including:

* A [landing page](#landing-page) containing:
  * An explanation of the project.
  * Links to each visualizations page. There should be a sidebar containing preview images of each plot, and clicking an image should take the user to that visualization.
* Four [visualization pages](#visualization-pages), each with:
  * A descriptive title and heading tag.
  * The plot/visualization itself for the selected comparison.
  * A paragraph describing the plot and its significance.
* A ["Comparisons" page](#comparisons-page) that:
  * Contains all of the visualizations on the same page so we can easily visually compare them.
  * Uses a Bootstrap grid for the visualizations.
* A ["Data" page](#data-page) that:
  * Displays a responsive table containing the data used in the visualizations.
